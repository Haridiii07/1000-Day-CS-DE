- **Schedule:** Saturday-Thursday: 2 blocks/day, Friday: 1 block/day
- **Total Hours:** ~570 hours

**Tiered Allocation:**
- **Tier 1 (150 hours each):** Algorithms & Data Structures, Databases
- **Tier 2 (75 hours each):** Operating Systems, Computer Networking
- **Tier 3 (40 hours each):** Programming (SICP partial), Computer Architecture

**Topics Covered:**
1. **Programming (SICP - 40 hours):** First 1.5 chapters (procedural abstraction, recursion, HOFs, basic data abstraction)
2. **Computer Architecture (CS:APP - 40 hours):** Memory hierarchy, performance, data representation
3. **Algorithms & Data Structures (ADM - 150 hours):** Complete coverage
4. **Operating Systems (OSTEP - 75 hours):** Memory management, concurrency, I/O, file systems
5. **Computer Networking (Top-Down - 75 hours):** Application/Transport/Network layers, protocols
6. **Databases (Red Book & CS 186 - 150 hours):** Relational theory, storage, indexing, transactions, distributed DBs

**Topics NOT Covered:**
- Math for Computer Science
- Compilers
- Distributed Systems (covered in Databases partially)
- Full SICP (only first 1.5 chapters)

**Resources Included:**
- Detailed task breakdowns for each topic (`*_tasks_full.md` files)

## FAQ

### Which roadmap should I choose?

See [Roadmap Comparison & Selection Guide](#roadmap-comparison--selection-guide) for detailed recommendations. In short:
- **New to programming:** 145-Week with Pre-Flight
- **Some experience, want structure:** 143-Week or 858-Day
- **Need job quickly:** 16-Week Accelerated
- **CS foundation first:** Tiered CS Approach

### Can I switch roadmaps mid-journey?

Yes! The roadmaps cover similar topics, just with different structures. You can:
- Start with 16-Week Accelerated, then continue with 143-Week for deeper CS
- Start with Tiered CS, then add DE skills from 143-Week
- Follow 145-Week but adjust pace based on employment status

### How do I balance studying with a job?

If you get a job before completing the roadmap:
- Continue with part-time study (reduce to 2-3 hours/day)
- Focus on topics most relevant to your role
- Use work projects as learning opportunities
- Maintain weekly progress (even if slower)

### What if I fall behind?

**Don't panic!** The roadmaps are guides, not rigid requirements:
- Adjust timeline as needed
- Focus on understanding over speed
- Review difficult topics before moving on
- Take breaks when needed (burnout is real)

### Do I need to complete all 9 TYCS topics?

For Data Engineering, the **Tiered CS Approach** (6 topics) is sufficient. However, completing all 9 topics gives you:
- Deeper theoretical foundation
- Better system design skills
- More competitive for senior roles
- Broader career options

### How do I know if I'm ready to apply for jobs?

See [Job Application Strategy](#job-application-strategy). Key indicators:
- **Week 32:** You have core DE skills (Python, SQL, dbt, Airflow) + project
- **Week 56:** You have big data skills (Spark, Kafka) + distributed systems knowledge

### Should I follow the Content Marketing Strategy?

**Highly recommended!** It helps you:
- Build a professional portfolio
- Attract recruiters
- Demonstrate commitment
- Network with other engineers
- Document your journey

However, it's optional. Focus on learning first, then add content creation if you have time.
