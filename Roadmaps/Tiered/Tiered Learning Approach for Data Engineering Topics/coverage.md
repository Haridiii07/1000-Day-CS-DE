### Programming (SICP - 40 hours/48 blocks)

- **Current Coverage**: First 1.5 chapters (out of 5 total chapters)
- **Topics Covered**: Procedural abstraction, recursion, higher-order functions, basic data abstraction
- **Topics Omitted**: Interpreters, register machines, metalinguistic abstraction, symbolic computation, compiler implementation


## Assessment for Data Engineering

The partial coverage of SICP (only the first 1.5 chapters) is **sufficient for your data engineering goals** for the following reasons:

1. **Practical Foundations**: The covered portions of SICP provide the essential programming foundations needed for data engineering: abstraction, recursion, higher-order functions, and basic data structures.
    
2. **Complementary Coverage**: The extensive coverage in Databases, Algorithms, and Operating Systems compensates for the limited SICP coverage by providing depth in areas directly relevant to data engineering.
    
3. **Appropriate Focus**: The omitted SICP chapters (interpreters, compilers, register machines) are more relevant for language designers, compiler engineers, and computer scientists than for practicing data engineers.
    
4. **Time Allocation Alignment**: The tiered approach you've taken appropriately allocates more time to topics with direct data engineering relevance (Databases, Algorithms) and less time to supporting topics (Programming, Computer Architecture).
    

## What You're Not Missing

While the later chapters of SICP are intellectually valuable, they focus on:

- Building interpreters and compilers
- Understanding evaluation models
- Implementing programming languages
- Register machines and low-level computation models

These topics, while fascinating and foundational to computer science theory, are rarely directly applied in day-to-day data engineering work. Most data engineers work with existing languages and systems rather than building new ones.

## Conclusion

The current study plan is well-designed for someone without a CS degree aiming to excel in data engineering. The partial coverage of SICP is a reasonable trade-off that allows you to invest more time in directly applicable areas like databases and algorithms.

If you ever wish to deepen your theoretical computer science knowledge or move toward language design or compiler development, you could always revisit the later chapters of SICP as a separate study project.


and what about the rest?

Regarding the rest of the topics in your CS study plan, here's my assessment of their coverage and relevance to data engineering:

## Computer Architecture (CS:APP - 40 hours)

The coverage is focused on the most relevant aspects for data engineers:

- Memory hierarchy and performance (crucial for understanding data system performance)
- Processor architecture and optimization (helpful for code efficiency)
- Data representation (important for storage considerations)

What you're not missing: The plan skips some advanced hardware-specific details and specialized processor architectures that rarely impact data engineering work directly.

## Operating Systems (OSTEP - 75 hours)

The coverage is well-targeted for data engineering needs:

- Memory management and virtual memory (critical for understanding database behavior)
- Concurrency and synchronization (essential for distributed data systems)
- I/O and file systems (fundamental to data storage and retrieval)

What you're not missing: Detailed kernel implementation, device drivers, and some advanced security mechanisms that are less relevant to data engineering.

## Computer Networking (Top-Down Approach - 75 hours)

The networking curriculum covers all essential aspects:

- Application layer protocols (HTTP, DNS) used in distributed data systems
- Transport layer (TCP/UDP) understanding needed for reliable data transfer
- Network layer concepts important for distributed system design

What you're not missing: Low-level network hardware details and some specialized protocols that most data engineers don't interact with directly.

## Algorithms & Data Structures (ADM - 150 hours)

This area has excellent coverage with no significant gaps:

- All fundamental data structures and algorithms
- Analysis techniques and complexity considerations
- Problem-solving approaches directly applicable to data processing

## Databases (Red Book & CS 186 - 150 hours)

The database curriculum is comprehensive and directly aligned with data engineering:

- Relational theory and SQL (core skills)
- Storage engines and indexing (critical for optimization)
- Query processing and optimization (essential for performance)
- Transaction management (crucial for data integrity)
- Distributed databases (increasingly important in modern data engineering)

Overall, the tiered approach you've taken is excellent. The topics with the most direct relevance to data engineering (Databases, Algorithms) receive the most time, while supporting topics receive appropriate but more focused coverage. This approach ensures you'll have both breadth and depth in the areas that matter most for data engineering excellence.
