*(Note: This is a high-level projection for the remaining modules. Each lecture by Skiena typically covers a substantial amount of material, often corresponding to sections or even full chapters of ADM. The 180 blocks will be meticulously planned to balance theory from the book, examples from lectures, problem-solving, and reading War Stories for practical context. Given the volume, some advanced or less data-engineering-centric topics from ADM Part II might be covered at a higher level or skipped to ensure the core material is well understood within the 150-hour budget.)*
