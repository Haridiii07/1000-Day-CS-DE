To complete all nine topics from the *Teach Yourself Computer Science* (TYCS) curriculum in one year without skipping any parts, studying 4–6 hours per day, 5 days a week, let’s calculate the feasibility and provide a plan.

### 1. Time Estimation
- **Total hours required**: TYCS estimates 100–200 hours per topic. Using the midpoint of 150 hours per topic for comprehensive study (including theory, exercises, and practice), 9 topics × 150 hours = **1,350 hours**.
- **Study schedule**: 4–6 hours/day, 5 days/week = 20–30 hours/week. Using the midpoint of **25 hours/week**:
  - **Total time**: 1,350 hours ÷ 25 hours/week = **54 weeks** ≈ **12.5 months**.
- **Feasibility in one year**: A year has 52 weeks, so 54 weeks slightly exceeds one year. However, by optimizing your study approach or if you learn faster (closer to 100 hours/topic), you can fit it within a year.

To meet the one-year goal (52 weeks):
- **Required hours per week**: 1,350 hours ÷ 52 weeks ≈ **26 hours/week**.
- **Daily commitment**: 26 hours/week ÷ 5 days/week ≈ **5.2 hours/day**, which fits within your 4–6 hours/day range.

Thus, completing all nine topics in one year is **feasible** if you study ~5.2 hours/day, 5 days/week, assuming 150 hours per topic.

### 2. Is the 100–200 Hours per Topic Estimate Accurate?
The 100–200 hours estimate is reasonable for someone without a CS background studying comprehensively:
- **Why accurate**: Each topic (e.g., Algorithms, Distributed Systems) is broad, requiring understanding theory, solving problems, and applying concepts (e.g., coding, system design). Books like *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* or *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* are dense, and practice (e.g., coding algorithms, building databases) takes time.
- **Variability**: If you have some programming or math experience, you might approach the lower end (100 hours) for topics like Programming or Math for CS. Complex topics like Distributed Systems or Compilers may take closer to 200 hours due to their depth and need for practical application.
- **Your case**: Since you want to cover all parts without skipping, assume ~150 hours/topic to account for thorough learning and practice, especially given your non-CS background.

### 3. Study Plan to Complete All 9 Topics in One Year
To finish in 52 weeks, you’ll need a structured approach:
- **Time per topic**: 1,350 hours ÷ 9 topics ≈ **150 hours/topic**. At 25 hours/week, each topic takes ~6 weeks (150 ÷ 25 = 6).
- **Schedule**: Study one topic at a time sequentially to maintain focus and depth. This gives ~6 weeks per topic, fitting 9 topics in 54 weeks (slightly adjusted to 52 weeks by increasing daily hours slightly).

**Weekly breakdown** (assuming 5.2 hours/day, 5 days/week ≈ 26 hours/week):
1. **Weeks 1–6**: Programming (*Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*, Berkeley CS 61A)
2. **Weeks 7–12**: Computer Architecture (*Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective*, Berkeley CS 61C)
3. **Weeks 13–18**: Algorithms and Data Structures (*The Algorithm Design Manual*, Steven Skiena’s lectures)
4. **Weeks 19–24**: Math for CS (*Mathematics for Computer Science*, MIT 6.042J)
5. **Weeks 25–30**: Operating Systems (*Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces*, Berkeley CS 162)
6. **Weeks 31–36**: Computer Networking (*Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach*, Stanford CS 144)
7. **Weeks 37–42**: Databases (*Readings in Database Systems*, Berkeley CS 186)
8. **Weeks 43–48**: Languages and Compilers (*Crafting Interpreters*, Alex Aiken’s edX course)
9. **Weeks 49–52**: Distributed Systems (*Designing Data-Intensive Applications*, MIT 6.824)

**Adjusting for 52 weeks**: To fit within 52 weeks, slightly increase your study time to ~5.3–5.5 hours/day (27.5 hours/week) or reduce each topic to ~144 hours (1,350 ÷ 52 ≈ 26 hours/week ÷ 9 topics). Alternatively, if you learn faster (e.g., 130 hours/topic), total time drops to 1,170 hours (45 weeks), giving you a buffer.

### 4. Optimizing Your Study Approach
To ensure you cover all parts of each topic efficiently:
- **Use recommended resources**: Stick to TYCS’s books and videos (e.g., *The Algorithm Design Manual*, Berkeley CS 61A lectures). Supplement with online platforms like LeetCode (for Algorithms), SQLZoo (for Databases), or cloud sandboxes (for Distributed Systems).
- **Practice heavily**: Dedicate ~30–40% of your time to hands-on work (e.g., coding recursion for Programming, building a small database for Databases, or simulating a distributed system). This reinforces theory and builds skills for SaaS development.
- **Prioritize understanding**: Don’t rush through complex topics (e.g., Distributed Systems, Compilers). Use forums like Stack Overflow or X communities for clarification.
- **Track progress**: Break each topic into subtopics (e.g., for Algorithms: stacks, queues, graphs). Complete 1–2 subtopics per week, using exercises from books or lectures.
- **Manage burnout**: Studying 5.2 hours/day is intense. Take short breaks, review weekly progress, and adjust if a topic takes longer (e.g., redistribute hours from faster topics like Programming to slower ones like Distributed Systems).

### 5. Will This Make You “Perfect” in CS and Able to Build a SaaS Business Alone?
**CS proficiency**: Completing all nine topics without skipping parts will give you a comprehensive CS foundation, equivalent to a solid undergraduate CS degree. You’ll master programming, algorithms, systems, and networking, making you highly capable as a data engineer and software developer. However, “perfection” is unattainable—CS evolves, and you’ll need to keep learning (e.g., new tools, frameworks).

**Building a SaaS business alone**:
- **Technical skills**: The curriculum covers critical areas for SaaS (e.g., Databases for data storage, Networking for APIs, Distributed Systems for scalability). You’ll be able to build a backend-heavy SaaS (e.g., a data-driven web app).
- **Gaps to fill**: TYCS doesn’t cover:
  - **Frontend development**: Learn HTML/CSS/JavaScript and a framework like React (add ~100–200 hours post-TYCS).
  - **Cloud platforms**: Study AWS, GCP, or Azure for deployment (add ~50–100 hours).
  - **Business skills**: Marketing, customer acquisition, and pricing are crucial for SaaS success. Learn these via resources like Indie Hackers or *The Lean Startup* (add ~50–100 hours).
- **Practical steps**: During your study, build small SaaS prototypes (e.g., a task management app) to apply skills. After TYCS, dedicate 3–6 months to learning frontend and cloud tools while starting your SaaS project.

### 6. Final Recommendations
- **Commitment**: Study ~5.3 hours/day, 5 days/week (27.5 hours/week) to complete 1,350 hours in 52 weeks. Follow the 6-week-per-topic schedule above.
- **Resources**: Use TYCS’s books and videos. Supplement with practical tools (LeetCode, GitHub, cloud platforms) and communities (X, Reddit) for support.
- **Practice**: Build projects for each topic (e.g., a database-backed app for Databases, a REST API for Networking). This ensures you can apply concepts to SaaS development.
- **Post-TYCS**: Allocate 3–6 months to learn frontend development, cloud platforms, and basic business skills. Start a small SaaS project during your studies to gain experience.
- **Feasibility check**: If any topic takes longer (e.g., Distributed Systems), reduce depth in less critical areas (e.g., Compilers) or extend slightly beyond a year. Monitor progress monthly.

This plan will make you a proficient data engineer and equip you to build a SaaS business, though additional learning and business skills are needed for entrepreneurial success.
