*(Note: This is a structured representation. The actual depth and pacing for each block might vary based on individual understanding. The Brian Harvey lectures should be interleaved appropriately with the SICP readings and exercises. The full SICP book covers much more, and these 48 blocks are focused on the initial, foundational parts relevant to the allocated 40 hours.)*
