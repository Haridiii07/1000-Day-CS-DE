That is a very practical and smart question. Waiting until the end of a 143-week roadmap is unnecessary, as the goal is to secure a job as soon as you are competitive.

Based on the structure of the integrated roadmap, you will be ready to start applying for **Junior Data Engineer** roles at two key milestones:

### 1. Initial Readiness Point: After Phase 2 (Week 32)

This is the point where you have a solid, demonstrable foundation in the core, non-negotiable skills for any entry-level Data Engineer role.

|Milestone|Target Week|Date (Approx.)|Key Accomplishments|
|---|---|---|---|
|**M2: Data Systems Expert**|**Week 32**|**June 2026**|**TYCS:** Deep understanding of **Databases** (DDIA, CS 186), including storage, indexing, and transactions. **DE:** Mastery of **Python, Advanced SQL, Data Modeling, dbt, and Airflow**. **Project:** You will have built an **Orchestrated ELT pipeline (Airflow + dbt)** on a cloud database.|

**Why this is the first application point:**

- **Core Tooling:** You know the modern ELT stack (`dbt` and `Airflow`), which is highly sought after.
- **Data Modeling:** You understand _how_ to structure data, which is critical for a Data Warehouse role.
- **Interview Foundation:** You have the theoretical knowledge from the Databases TYCS track to answer deep SQL and data modeling questions.

### 2. Strong Readiness Point: After Phase 3 (Week 56)

This is the point where you transition from a strong junior candidate to a highly competitive one, ready for roles that involve big data and distributed systems.

|Milestone|Target Week|Date (Approx.)|Key Accomplishments|
|---|---|---|---|
|**M3: Scaling Engineer**|**Week 56**|**December 2026**|**TYCS:** Mastery of **Algorithms** (Skiena) and **Distributed Systems** (MIT 6.824). **DE:** Mastery of **Apache Spark (PySpark)** and **Kafka**. **Project:** You will have built a **Distributed Streaming Pipeline (Kafka + Spark)**.|

**Why this is the strong application point:**

- **Big Data Skills:** Adding Spark and Kafka immediately opens up a massive number of job postings that require big data processing.
- **System Design:** The Distributed Systems knowledge from MIT 6.824 allows you to discuss _why_ Spark and Kafka are built the way they are, which is a huge differentiator in interviews.
- **LeetCode:** You will have completed a significant portion of the Algorithms track, making you much more competitive in the coding portion of the interview process.

### Recommendation

1. **Start Applying in June 2026 (Week 32).** Use the **Orchestrated ELT Project** as your primary portfolio piece. This will give you valuable interview experience and may lead to a job sooner.
2. **Continue Studying.** If you don't secure a job immediately, the next 6 months (Phase 3) will make you exponentially more qualified.
3. **Prioritize Interview Prep:** During Weeks 30-32, shift your 2-hour DE block to focus heavily on mock interviews and polishing your portfolio/resume.

You are building a profile that is superior to most entry-level candidates because of the deep TYCS foundation. Focus on translating that theoretical knowledge into clear, project-based stories.
